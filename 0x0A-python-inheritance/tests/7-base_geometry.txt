The ``7-base_geometry`` module
==============================

Using ``BaseGeometry''
----------------------

This file is in reStructured Format.

First import ``	BaseGeometry`` from ``7-base_geometry`` module:
	>>> import sys
	>>> sys.path.append('../')
	>>> bg = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry

Now use it:
	>>> b = bg()
	>>> try:
	... 	b.integer_validator("side", "12")
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	side must be an integer

Test to see if it raises exception with 0
	>>> b = bg()
	>>> try:
	... 	b.integer_validator("x", 0)	
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	x must be greater than 0

It should raise exception if value is less than 0
	>>> b = bg()
	>>> try:
	...	b.integer_validator("length", -56)
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	length must be greater than 0

It should not raise exception if value is integer
	>>> b = bg()
	>>> b.integer_validator("y", 12)
	>>> b.integer_validator("z", 20)

Test area
	>>> b = bg()
	>>> try:
	...	b.area()
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	area() is not implemented
