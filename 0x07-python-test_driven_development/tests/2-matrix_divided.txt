The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
===============================

Using ``matrix_divided``
------------------------

This is a text file reStructured format.

First import ``matrix_divided`` from ``2-matrix_divided`` module:
	>>> import sys
	>>> sys.path.append('../')
	>>> div = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Now use it:

	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> mat = div(matrix, 3)
	>>> print(mat)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
	>>> print(matrix)
	[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

Raises a type error if rows of matrix are not the same size
	>>> matrix = [[1, 4, 8], [6, 9]]
	>>> try:
	...	 mat = div(matrix, 2)
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print (e)
	each row of the matrix must have the same size

Fails if div is 0
	>>> matrix = [[5, 7, 2], [6, 3, 1]]
	>>> try:
	...	 mat = div(matrix, 0)
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	division by zero

Div should only be a number
	>>> matrix = [[1, 8, 9], [5, 3, 4]]
	>>> try:
	...	 mat = div(matrix, '2')
	... except Exception as e:
	...	print(e)
	div must be a number

Fails if any of the elements is not a number
	>>> matrix = [[23, 10, 15], [80, '45', "0"]]
	>>> try:
	...	 mat = div(matrix, 10)
	... except Exception as e:
	... 	print(e)
	matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
